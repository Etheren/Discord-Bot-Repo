MAJOR:-

"stopGambling" has been added as a command for Higher/Lower. You can use this instead of continuing and taking home what you have earned.

The following commands have had their name changed:
    doorLeft -> left
    doorRight -> right
    pickHigher -> higher
    pickLower -> lower
Their functionality remains the same.

Party Door functionality has changed. It will now point to the correct door, instead of generating a correct one from thin air. 
Every floor is now guaranteed to have 1 correct and 1 incorrect door.

Party Doors can now spawn after a Higher/Lower minigame, regardless of the minigame result.  


MINOR:-

New output strings can output if the player gets to play Higher/Lower in the final chamber.


BALANCING :-

Higher/Lower chance of spawning has been decreased from 20% to 10%
