# Discord-Bot-Repo
Code used to run Etherbot, a discord bot.

This bot is written in Python, using the Discord.py API to handle calls. With sufficient dependancies fulfilled, this code can be ran on a Raspberry Pi, and was originally intended to do so.

To run this, insert your Bot Token inside a file called discordtoken.py stored under the name "TOKEN" (Caps are needed), and run mainbody.py. Give it a second or 2 to boot up, and you should have a running discord bot. Woo!

Currently a W.I.P, once I figure out what features I'd like to implement onto it, and figured out how to code said bot.

If you have any suggestions for what may be a nice feature to have, Open a Issue with the feature tag and I'll look at it whenever.
