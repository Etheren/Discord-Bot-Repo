# Discord-Bot-Repo
Code used to run AmiBot, a discord bot named after my current FFXIV Character, Ami Glissando.

This bot is written in Python, using the Discord.py API to handle calls. With sufficient dependancies fulfilled, this code can be ran on a Raspberry Pi, and was originally intended to do so.

To run this, insert your Bot Token inside a file called discordtoken.py stored under the name "TOKEN" (Caps are needed), and run mainbody.py. Give it a second or 2 to boot up, and you should have a running discord bot. Woo!

Currently a W.I.P, once I figure out what features I'd like to implement onto it, and figured out how to code said bot.

Current "Features":
# "Map Mode" - A Simulator for Final Fantasy XIV Treasure Maps. Pick Left/Right doors to get to the end, with functional High/Low minigame and "Party Door"

# "Voice Mode" - Music Playback. Currently the W.I.P Feature.

If you have any suggestions for what may be a nice feature to have, Open a Issue with the feature tag and I'll look at it whenever.
